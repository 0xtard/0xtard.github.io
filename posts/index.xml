&lt;p>With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), often incorrectly referred to as AI by the technically illiterate, everything changed. So-called &amp;lsquo;slop&amp;rsquo; emerged from the TPUs of these neural networks2. An unprecedented amount of data and content flooded the web.

People appreciate human-like content, texts, poems, movies, articles, and essays, yet few create them, instead letting machines do the work. It&amp;rsquo;s despicable.
The concerning part is that it&amp;rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between human-created and machine-generated content2. You cannot easily see or notice if it was made by a human or hallucinated by a machine.&lt;/p>
