The Internet was usable and, to some extent, enjoyable.</p><p>With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), often incorrectly referred to as AI by the technically illiterate, everything changed. So-called &lsquo;slop&rsquo; emerged from the TPUs of these neural networks2. An unprecedented amount of data and content flooded the web. Everyone wants to create LLM content, but simultaneously, everyone wants to dismantle it. People appreciate human-like content, texts, poems, movies, articles, and essays, yet few create them, instead letting machines do the work. It&rsquo;s despicable.
The concerning part is that it&rsquo;s becoming increasingly difficult to differentiate between human-created and machine-generated content2. You cannot easily see or notice if it was made by a human or hallucinated by a machine.</p><p>Therefore, avoiding the Internet in its current state may be the most prudent course of action one could take</p></div></div><div class=pagination><div class=pagination__title><span class=pagination__title-h>Read other posts</span><hr></div><div class=pagination__buttons><a href=https://0xtard.github.io/posts/post/ class="button inline next">whoami | 0xtard</a></div></div></article></div><footer class=footer><div class=footer__inner><div class=copyright><span>© 2025 Powered by <a href=https://gohugo.io>Hugo</a></span>
